# mouseKBtracker.py
A simple program to determine where your mouse is on the screen, and see if the device detects keystrokes.<br>
<i>Additional feature: Determine where the center of the screen is by using the Move To Center button. </i><br>
Note: this is basically my PySimpleGUI practice.

# nineLetterWordC.py
A script to automate the process of playing the <a href='https://nineletterword.tompaton.com/'>nine letter word game</a>. The C in the title stands for Cheating.

# scrabbleSearcher.py
A script to search for words that can be formed by your hand in Scrabble. No blank cards nor special tiles. May take a while depending on the length of your Hand or device performance.<br>
<i>Utilises the txt file of <a href = 'https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/'>english-words by dwyl.</a></i>

# wordPuddle.py
A script to search for valid words to play in a game similar to Nine Letter Word, with no relation to the site. Just displays results.<br>
No length restrictions, but length must be an odd number. <br>
May take a while depending on the length of your Hand or device performance.<br>
<i>Utilises the txt file of <a href = 'https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/'>english-words by dwyl.</a></i>
